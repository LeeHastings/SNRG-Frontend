## SNRG Configuration Frontend
This is an application designed to improve the ease of use in designing simulations for the SNRG social network simulator.  

It is a GUI application consisting of three packages: `ui`, the package which produces the GUI using JavaFX; `model`, which the `ui` package interfaces with and which manages the internal structure; and `persistence`, which takes the data generated by the `model` and produces the final output for the simulator to use. For now, this output is a collection of JSON files.

The application is currently nearing completion of its first phase: letting the user create the node settings for the simulation from a GUI, with many of the properties being supported. After that, there are edge settings, aggregate settings, configuration files, and other utilities that need to be created.

For testing the software without building it, binary packages are located in `bin\Application.[build date].jar`, and these files will be updated regularly.
