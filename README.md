## SNRG Configuration Frontend
This is an application designed to improve the ease of use in designing simulations for the SNRG social network simulator.  

It is a GUI application consisting of three packages: `ui`, the package which produces the GUI using javaFX, `model`, which the `ui` package interfaces with, and `persistence`, which takes the data generated by the `model` and produces the final output for the simulator.

Currently, the application is nearing completion of its first phase, letting the user create the node settings for the simulation from a GUI. After that, there are edge settings, aggregate settings, configuration files, and other utilities that need to be created.
